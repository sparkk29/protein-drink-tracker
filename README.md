Link to live app: [protein-shake-tracker.netlify.app](https://protein-shake-tracker.netlify.app/)

You can get this app onto your phone for free by going down to the "sharing" options on your phone and then selecting "add to home" or something like that. If you can't figure it out ask ChatGPT or google it or something, the future is now.

This is a simple Progressive Web App to track your daily protein drink intake.  
This project is **open-source** and primarily for **educational purposes**, so small features, bug fixes, and improvements are all welcome.
Below is a description of steps to follow to contribute to this project.

Additionally, here are some YouTube videos that walk through contributing to opensource projects!

## Contributing Guide

We encourage contributions from everyone. This guide explains step-by-step how to contribute via **pull requests (PRs)**.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of the GitHub page.  
This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account where you have write access.

---

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes instead of working on `main` directly:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```
Use a descriptive branch name like fix/button-color or feature/dark-mode.

---

### 3. Make Your Changes
* Add features, fix bugs, or improve documentation.

* Keep your code clean, readable, and self-contained.

* Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add dark mode toggle"
```

---

### 4. Push Your Branch to Your Fork

Push the branch with your changes to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

---

### 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.

2. Click Compare & pull request.

3. Make sure the base repository is softwarewithnick/ProteinTracker and the base branch is main.

4. Give your PR a descriptive title and provide a clear description:

   * What changes you made

   * Why these changes are useful

   * Reference any related issue (e.g., Closes #5) if applicable

   * Submit the PR.

5. Small contributions are absolutely welcome! Even tiny fixes or minor UI improvements help the project.

---

### 6. PR Review

* Maintainers will review your PR.

* They may request changes or provide feedback — this is normal.

* Push updates to the same branch; your PR will automatically update.

* Once approved, your PR will be merged into main.

---

### 7. Stay in Sync

If other changes are merged while your PR is open, keep your fork up-to-date:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```
Replace upstream with the remote pointing to the original repository.

---

### 8. Optional: Opening Issues First

For larger changes or new features, it’s helpful to open an issue first:

1. Describe the problem or feature idea.
2. Wait for discussion or approval before starting work.
3. Reference the issue in your PR (e.g., `Closes #10`).

> This keeps the project organized and prevents duplicate effort.

## Notes

- This project is **educational**, so experimentation is encouraged.
- Every contribution counts — from small bug fixes to new features.
